			<b>Staple Pigeon</b> pictured above is a NYC based streetwear brand that was started by <b>Jeff Staple</b> in 1997.What started as a small t-shirt line handmade by JeffStaple, who was then a student at Parsons School of Design, grew organically and began to gain visibility in the city. To some, it's just another streetwear brand with cool designs and concepts, but to NYC natives who know the history, <a href="#" target="_blank" class="http://staplepigeon.com/">Staple Pigeon</a> is and will always be a pioneer in the streetwear culture.In the process of building this burgeoning brand, Nike hired Jeff Staple in 2005 to create a special sneaker to represent New York. The Staple Pigeon icon was conceived and was branded on the heels of a limited (and now most coveted) 150 pairs of the popular Nike Dunk Pro SB, leading to much fanfare upon its release and exposing sneaker culture, and Staple, to the masses. The Staple Pigeon is now a world renowned symbol which reflects the gritty and reckless energy New Yorkers (and all urban dwellers) possess. It not only exists as a representation of New York but is also the influence behind Staple’s extensive apparel range and collaborative products distributed in the top retailers across the globe. Inspired by street culture and design, Staple’s reach encompasses many different landscapes such as music, art, and fashion.
