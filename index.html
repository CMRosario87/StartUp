		 <p>     I am a 27 year old NYC native who has a passion for Urban Streetwear culture and Technology. I enjoy going to Underground Hip-Hop shows and Streetwear events throughout NYC when I have the free time. Recently I was working for a Fortune 500 company for about 3 years before I decided enough was enough. I decided to quit my job as a Banker to pursue a life long personal goal,to learn Web Design.I began my search for a local NYC company who was willing to teach me Web Design at a reasonable price. My search ended when I found the StartUp Institute here in NYC. Upon completion of RampUp I plan to pursue the Full-time Web design course here at StartUp Institute. I really enjoy learning HTML so far and can't wait to dig deeper into Web Design.</p>
